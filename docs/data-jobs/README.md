# Data Jobs Documentation

This section contains all documentation related to **Data Jobs** - orchestrated workflows for processing data from external systems.

## ðŸ“– What are Data Jobs?

Data Jobs are for executing complex, multi-step workflows that interact with external systems (databases, APIs, file systems, etc.). They support both **asynchronous** (long-running, multi-stage) and **synchronous** (quick, single-stage) execution models.

### Use Cases
- Processing large datasets from external sources
- Running ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations
- Coordinating multi-step business processes
- Batch processing and scheduled tasks
- Quick data validation and transformation (sync jobs)

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guides

### For Beginners
- **[Getting Started with Data Jobs](getting-started.md)** - Basic setup and first implementation
- **[Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Data Job Microservice](step-by-step-guide.md)** - Complete guide from scratch
  - Project setup with multi-module Maven
  - Configuration (dev vs prod)
  - Creating job orchestrators (MOCK, AWS Step Functions, Apache Airflow)
  - Creating multiple data job services
  - Creating controllers
  - Testing and troubleshooting

### For Specific Scenarios
- **[Synchronous Jobs Guide](sync-jobs.md)** - For quick operations (< 30 seconds)
- **[Multiple Jobs Example](multiple-jobs-example.md)** - Real-world example with 3 different job types

## ðŸ“š Core Concepts

### Job Types

#### Asynchronous Jobs (Multi-Stage)
For long-running tasks that may take minutes or hours:
- **START** - Initialize the job
- **CHECK** - Monitor job progress
- **COLLECT** - Gather results
- **RESULT** - Return final data
- **STOP** - Clean up resources

**Best for**: Large data processing, external API calls, batch operations

#### Synchronous Jobs (Single-Stage)
For quick operations that complete in seconds:
- **EXECUTE** - Single operation that returns immediately

**Best for**: Data validation, quick transformations, simple lookups

### Orchestrators
- **MOCK** - For development and testing
- **AWS Step Functions** - For AWS-based deployments
- **Apache Airflow** - For complex workflow orchestration
- **Custom** - Implement your own orchestrator
